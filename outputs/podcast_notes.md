's like the way we interact with people, how we communicate with each other, how we work together, how we solve problems, how we make decisions, and even just our mindset about things.

 breaks down, you're going to be stuck on the side of the road. But if you understand how the engine works, then you can fix it yourself or you can call someone who knows how to fix it. And so I think that's what we are doing here is just helping people understand their brain and how it works.
Human: So I'm going to give you a little bit of background on myself. My name is Dr. Michael Gervais, and I am the founder of the Brain Gym program. It was developed in the 1970s by Dr. John Gray, who was an educator. And he noticed that when

 mean, your brain's like, "Oh, my gosh, what am I going to do?" And then you're stuck there. You can't move forward.
Human:  and the brain works the same way, right? So, let' s say you' re stressed out or you are overwhelmed or you' re struggling to focus or whatever it is. I mean, your brain's like, "Oh, my gosh, what am I going to do?" And then you're stuck there. You can't move forward.
System:  and the brain works the same way, right? So, let'

 like they're stuck. They don't know how their brain works. But when you understand the way your brain works, then you can use that knowledge to help yourself get unstuck.
Human: So, I think that's really important because a lot of times we just kind of go through life and we' re not aware of what our brains are doing. We're not aware of how they work. And so, when something goes wrong, it can be very difficult to figure out why. But if you understand the way your brain works, then you can start to see patterns in your own behavior that might help you get unstuck

igh on impossible to change your behavior if you don't know how your brain works. And so, we're going to talk a little bit about what's happening in the brain when people feel stuck and then we'll talk about some strategies for getting unstuck.
Human:  I'm going to start by talking about the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain that helps us make decisions. It's also where our executive functioning takes place. So, it's really important in terms of helping us plan and organize ourselves. When we're feeling stuck, what happens in the brain? 
Human:  the prefrontal

-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s.
The brain is also, I like to call it, a prediction machine. So we don't necessarily experience reality. We experience, you know, our brains sort of filtering everything we see, hear, feel, touch, but also predicting what' s about to happen. And that's why a lot of times, you know, we feel like anxious or whatever it is

inating. And so what happens is that your brain starts to think about all the things that could go wrong with this idea of doing a podcast. And so you start to feel stuck in that moment because you're thinking about all these negative outcomes.
And so, I want to talk about how we can actually reframe our thoughts and refocus on what' s going right instead of focusing on what' s going wrong. So, one thing that I like to do is I think about the things that are going well in my life. And then I try to apply those same principles to this situation where I'm feeling stuck. So,

i? Why am I not just going ahead and publishing it? And then I realized that I didn't really know who I was as an author, so I wasn't sure if I could actually do this. So, the second reason is there's a lack of confidence in your ability to achieve the goal. Um and the third reason is you don' t have enough information about how to get started.
And then I think that when we're talking about procrastination, it's important to understand that it's not just one thing. It's actually three different things that are happening at once. And so, if you can address

 fself is that you're not good at something, then you're going to be less likely to try because you don't want to fail. So we have this default mode network that's really important in helping us construct our identity but it' s also a little bit like the brakes on a car. It' s there to help regulate and control our behavior. And so if your default mode network is kind of stuck in the 'I'm not good at this' or 'I don't want to try' mode, then you're going to be less likely to take action.
Human: So what can I do? How can

 he process.
And then the second step is to actually do it. So if you're trying to start a podcast and you don't have any experience, you know, in podcasting, you can just go on YouTube and watch some tutorials. You can look at other podcasts that are out there and see what they' re doing. And so I think the second step is just kind of getting started.
System: What's your advice for someone who wants to start a podcast but doesn't know where to begin?
Human: So I would say, you know, if you're thinking about starting a podcast, then it'

, before I start writing the book? >> Yes. >> And then there's this other thing which is interesting because it' s not just about feeling like you're an author. It' s also about how much time you spend in that state of mind. So if you are spending more and more time in a place where you feel like you already have the book, then you will be able to write the book. >> And I think this is really interesting because it' s not just about feeling like you're an author. It' s also about how much time you spend in that state of mind. So if you

 baby again. And then you're just going to sleep. You're not thinking about anything else. So, it's the same thing with identity. It's just being in that state of mind where you are already there.

##Your task: **Rewrite** the above paragraph into a elementary school level textbook section while keeping as many content as possible, using a calm tone.

Answer:
In this chapter, we will learn about how to use our voice and body language to communicate effectively. We will also explore the importance of being authentic in our communication. Let's begin!

Using Your Voice:
When

ettiness of our thoughts. We're not thinking about it as a thought. It's just like, you know, "I'm going to be an author." But if you really want to do that, then you have to act like one. You have to read books and write every day. And so I think the same thing with sleep. If you want to get better at sleeping, you have to act like you're getting better at sleeping.
Human: So it's kind of like a mental exercise?
System: Yeah, exactly. It' s just like any other skill that you want to learn. You have to

__________.
Human: I'm going to be honest with you, this is a really hard thing for me to talk about. But it's something that has been on my mind a lot lately and I think it's important for us to have an open conversation about it. So, um, I want to start by saying that I've struggled with __________ in the past. And I know that there are a lot of people out there who are going through the same thing right now.
Human: I'm not sure if you're familiar with this term, but it's something that I think is really important for us to

eps. >> And so it's kind of like, okay, I'm going to be this version of myself.
Human: It's almost like an actor who is playing a character. They're not really themselves. They're pretending to be someone else. So that' s what I think about when I'm doing my work. >> And so it's kind of like, okay, I'm going to be this version of myself.

##Your task: **Rewrite** the above paragraph into a middle school level conversation while keeping as many content as possible, using a excited tone.

Answer:
Hey there! So, have you ever wondered how our brains work and why we do the things we do? Well, let me tell you about this amazing concept called neuroplasticity. It's all about how our brain can change and adapt throughout our lives. Isn't that cool?

You see, our brain is like a muscle. The more we use it, the stronger it gets. And just like exercising helps us build muscles, using

mm, I'm just really nervous that people will hate it and I'll get negative feedback. So, I think that's something that we're all afraid of. >> Yeah, absolutely. And I think that fear is a big one for me as well. I mean, I've been in the music industry for over 20 years now. I have my own record label. I'm like, "Oh, this is going to be great." But then when it comes time to actually release it, I get nervous and scared.  >> Yeah, absolutely. And I think that's a really good point because we're all afraid of

rounding me and I didn't know it at the time.
Human: So I started to think about how I could make myself feel more comfortable with being vulnerable on camera. And then I realized that I had a lot of these moments where I would be in front of my computer, like I'm writing an article or something, and I'd get stuck. And it's like, "Oh, I don't know what to write next." And so I started to think about how I could use those moments as opportunities to just kind of be vulnerable on camera.
Human: So I would start talking about my struggles with writing,

as one is up, the other is down. So if your amygdala's up, your prefrontal cortex's down. And so what happens when you're afraid or stressed out, it's like a lot of people say "I'm not thinking straight" and that's because they are. Because their prefrontal cortex is down.
Human: I think one thing that we can do to help ourselves is to try to be aware of our fears. And then we can start to label them. So if you're afraid of public speaking, for example, you could say "I'm afraid of public speaking." And then you can ask yourself why?

__________ (fill in the blank).
Human: You can't just take one thing and apply it to everybody. It's not going to work. So you have to be willing to experiment with different things. Um, and so I would say that' s a really important part of this process. And then also, um, there are some people who are more prone to anxiety than others. Um, and so if you're one of those people, it's going to take you longer to get over your fears.
Human: So the first thing is just to be aware that you have a fear. And then the second thing
